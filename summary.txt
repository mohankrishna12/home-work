Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to software development and project management focused on delivering value quickly, responding to changing requirements, and promoting close collaboration between team members and customers.

Key Points of Agile
Mindset & Methodology: Agile is both a way of thinking (mindset) and a set of practices (methodologies) designed for adaptability and customer satisfaction.

Iterative & Incremental Development: Work is delivered in small, usable chunks (iterations or sprints), not all at once.

Customer Collaboration: Agile emphasizes frequent feedback and involvement from customers or stakeholders at every stage.

Responding to Change: Agile teams welcome evolving requirements, even late in development.

Teamwork: Self-organizing, cross-functional teams work together, communicate openly, and make decisions collectively.
